# From this [issue](https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues/1025#issuecomment-157059174):

# I know that this issue is closed, but as I spent a lot of time to understand what was going on, I made some researches and I can explain why this happen, and you can fix it.

# Using git config core.autocrlf true can help, but not on a multi-developpers project.
# This command has to be the same on each developper machine, and that's not always the case.

# You have to use the .gitattributes provided in the puphpet archive and edit it as follow (carefull, this file need to be in your project root)
# You also need to use an IDE that allow you to save/edit files as LF (like phpstorm). You can check the type of the file in the bottom right corner, in the status bar (you'll see LF or CRLF while a file is opened)

# .gitattributes
# =================================================
# These settings are for any web project

# Handle line endings automatically for files detected as text
# and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
* text=auto

#
## These files are binary and should be left untouched
#

# (binary is a macro for -text -diff)
