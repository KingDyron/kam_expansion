 <<KaM Remake FontX Editor>>
-----------------------------

Here's how it works: 
Place FontXEd into KaM Remake folder and run it. 
The tool will scan fonts folder and show all available fonts.
You can export PNGs, edit them in MSPaint/Photoshop/etc and import back - then updated font file can be saved.
Also you can type a sample phrase to see how it looks in KaM fonts.
